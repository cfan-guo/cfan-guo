# Hi, I'm Fan!

This is the emoji-free (accessible) version. For the one with emojis, please see this page [instead](https://github.com/cfan-guo/cfan-guo#readme).

I'm a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada, currently working at [Gobble](https://www.gobble.com/). Gobble is a dinner kit/ meal delivery service operating in the US, and my work spans both customer facing and admin features and improvements.

Previously, I worked at [Connected](https://connected.io/) on projects in related to AR/VR, computer aided design, data engineering and healthcare. 
I was also a team lead and an engineering manager.

Before that, I worked at [Flipp](https://flipp.com/) to help families find the best deals and save money. I was on a team that built and delivered customized desktop and mobile flyer themes and dynamic content for Canadian and US retailers on Flippâ€™s hosted platform

Usually I can be found offline pursuing one of my hobbies.
