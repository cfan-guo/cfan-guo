# Hi, I'm Fan!

This is the emoji-free (accessible) version. For the one with emojis, please see this page [instead](https://github.com/cfan-guo/cfan-guo#readme).

I'm a senior software engineer based in Toronto, Canada, currently working at [Jobber](https://getjobber.com/).

Previously, I was at [Properly](https://www.properly.ca/), a Canadian real estate startup which has since been acquired. I worked on SEO initiatives and product features on web and mobile!

Before that, I worked at [Gobble](https://www.gobble.com/), a dinner kit/ meal delivery service operating in the US. My work spanned both customer facing and admin features and improvements.

After graduating, I joined [Connected](https://connected.io/), which has since been acquired by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us/news/acquisitions/connected). I was also a team lead and an engineering manager.

My start in the industry was at [Flipp](https://flipp.com/). I was on a team that built and delivered customized desktop and mobile flyer themes and dynamic content for Canadian and US retailers on Flippâ€™s hosted platform.

Usually I can be found offline pursuing one of my hobbies.
